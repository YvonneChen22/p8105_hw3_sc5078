# Problem 1

load the dataset, instacart

``` r
data("instacart")
```

This dataset comprises 1384617 rows and 15 columns. Each row corresponds
to a single product within an Instacart order. The variables encompass
user, order, and product identifiers, as well as the order placement
sequence. Order-level attributes include details about the order’s day,
time, and days since the previous order. Additionally, item-specific
characteristics cover the product name (e.g., Yogurt, Avocado),
department (e.g., dairy and eggs, produce), aisle (e.g., yogurt, fresh
fruits), and whether the item has been previously ordered by the user.
In total, there are 39123 distinct products found in 131209 unique
orders placed by 131209 different users.

This is a table summarizing the number of items ordered from aisle. In
total, there are 134 aisles, with fresh vegetables being the most items
ordered by far.

``` r
instacart |> 
  count(aisle) |> 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 × 2

The plot shows the number of items ordered in each aisle, limiting this
to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered.

There are more male having high school equivalent education level than
female. There are more female have less than high school education or
more than high school education than male. For both male and female,
most of people having more than high school education.

Create a visualization of the age distributions for men and women in

The age distribution between female and male is similar in the “less
than high school” and “More than high school” education group. However,
for the “High school equivalent” education level, females would have a
higher maximum age, minimum age, and average age than males. For
females, “High school equivalent” education level has the highest mean
age, 57.39, while “More than high school” education level has the lowest
mean age, 45.68. For males, “Less than high school” have the highest
mean age, 57.22, while “More than high school” education level has the
lowest mean age, 46.61.
